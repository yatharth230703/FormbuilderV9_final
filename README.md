# FormBuilderV9: How It Works

## Overview

FormBuilderV9 is a full-stack, AI-powered form engine that generates, renders, and manages multi-step forms based on natural language prompts. The system is designed for flexibility, modularity, and a seamless user experience, supporting a wide variety of input types and edge cases.

---

## 1. System Architecture

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript (Vite), using a context-driven state management system and modular step components.
- **Backend:** Express.js (TypeScript), with Supabase for database/auth, Drizzle ORM, and Google Gemini API for AI-powered form generation.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase), storing form configs (as JSON), responses, and user/session data.

---

## 2. Data Flow: From Prompt to Interactive Form

### a. Form Generation

1. **User Input:** The user enters a natural language prompt describing the desired form.
2. **AI Processing:** The backend sends this prompt to the Gemini API, which returns a structured JSON config describing the form (steps, types, options, validation, etc.).
3. **Config Storage:** The JSON config is stored in the database and returned to the frontend.

### b. Form Rendering

1. **Config Loading:** The frontend fetches the JSON config (either on page load or after generation).
2. **Context Initialization:** The config is loaded into a React context (`FormContext`), which manages the current step, responses, and navigation.
3. **Dynamic Rendering:** The main form renderer (`FormRenderer` or `EmbedFormRenderer`) iterates through the `steps` array in the config, rendering the appropriate component for each step type.
4. **State Management:** User responses are tracked in context, and navigation (next/prev/submit) is managed centrally.

---

## 3. How UI Elements Interact

- **Step Components:** Each step type (tiles, multiSelect, slider, etc.) is a separate React component, receiving its config and state via context.
- **Navigation:** The renderer manages which step is currently visible. Navigation buttons (Next, Back, Submit) are context-aware and validate input before proceeding.
- **Validation:** Each step validates its input (required fields, min/max, etc.) before allowing navigation.
- **Response Aggregation:** All responses are stored in a single object, keyed by step title, and submitted as a batch at the end.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Each step type has custom logic for handling empty, invalid, or edge-case input (see below).

---

## 4. The JSON Config: Structure & Transformation

A sample config (see `server/services/gemini.ts` for the full schema):

```json
{
  "theme": { ... },
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "tiles",
      "title": "What are you looking for?",
      "subtitle": "Select the option that best describes your needs",
      "options": [ ... ]
    },
    {
      "type": "multiSelect",
      "title": "...",
      "options": [ ... ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "ui": { ... },
  "submission": { ... }
}
```

- **Strict Typing:** Only allowed step types are generated (`tiles`, `multiSelect`, `slider`, `followup`, `textbox`, `location`, `documentUpload`, `documentInfo`, `contact`).
- **Validation Rules:** Each step can specify validation (required, minLength, etc.).
- **UI Customization:** Button labels, messages, and theme colors/fonts are all configurable.

## 5. In-Depth: Each Slide (Step) Type

### 5.1 Tiles

- **Purpose:** Single-choice selection from 4 or 6 visually distinct options.
- **UI:** Grid of tiles, each with icon, title, and short description.
- **Interaction:** Clicking a tile selects it and (optionally) auto-advances.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If no option is preselected, the first option can be auto-selected.
  - Handles both 4 and 6 option layouts (responsive grid).
  - If the config is malformed (wrong number of options), falls back to a default grid.

### 5.2 MultiSelect

- **Purpose:** Multiple-choice selection from a set of options.
- **UI:** Similar to tiles, but allows multiple selections (checkboxes or toggles).
- **Interaction:** User can select/deselect any number of options.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - At least one selection is required (if specified).
  - Handles empty or duplicate options gracefully.

### 5.3 Slider

- **Purpose:** Numeric input within a range (e.g., budget, age).
- **UI:** Slider bar with min/max, current value, and optional prefix/suffix.
- **Interaction:** Drag to select value; value is shown live.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If no value is set, defaults to `defaultValue`.
  - Handles min > max or invalid step gracefully (disables slider).

### 5.4 Followup

- **Purpose:** Conditional input; user selects an option and provides a follow-up answer.
- **UI:** Options (like tiles), plus a follow-up input (text or number) shown after selection.
- **Interaction:** Selecting an option reveals the follow-up field.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Both option and follow-up must be filled to proceed.
  - Handles missing follow-up config by disabling the input.

### 5.5 Textbox

- **Purpose:** Freeform text input (short or long answer).
- **UI:** Textarea with placeholder, row count, and validation.
- **Interaction:** User types answer; validation shown live.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Enforces required/minLength if specified.
  - Shows error if input is too short or empty.

### 5.6 Location

- **Purpose:** Collects user location (postal code, country, etc.).
- **UI:** Input field(s) with custom placeholder.
- **Interaction:** User enters location; can be validated or auto-completed.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Required fields enforced.
  - Handles invalid or missing location gracefully.

### 5.7 DocumentUpload

- **Purpose:** Allows user to upload a document (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- **UI:** Drag-and-drop area, file picker, and upload status.
- **Interaction:** User uploads file; file is sent to backend for processing.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Accepts only allowed file types and sizes.
  - Shows error if upload fails or file is invalid.
  - If upload succeeds, extracted text is stored for use in later steps.

### 5.8 DocumentInfo

- **Purpose:** Displays information extracted from the uploaded document.
- **UI:** Scrollable area with extracted text or summary.
- **Interaction:** Read-only; user reviews the info.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Shows loading/error states if extraction fails.
  - Handles missing or empty document gracefully.

### 5.9 Contact

- **Purpose:** Collects user contact info (name, email, phone).
- **UI:** Input fields with validation.
- **Interaction:** User fills in details; email is validated live.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Enforces required fields (first name, email).
  - Validates email format.
  - Shows error for missing/invalid input.

---

## 6. Edge Case Handling (Frontend)

- **Validation:** Each step type has custom validation logic, enforced before navigation.
- **Fallbacks:** If config is missing or malformed, the UI falls back to safe defaults.
- **State Reset:** Changing the form config resets all responses and navigation.
- **Submission:** All responses are validated and aggregated before submission; errors are shown inline.
- **Theme/Font:** Theming and font changes are applied live and persist across steps.

---

## 7. UI/UX Details

- **16:9 Aspect Ratio:** All forms are rendered in a responsive 16:9 container for consistency.
- **Live Preview:** Editing the JSON or prompt updates the form in real time.
- **Embeddable:** Forms can be embedded via iframe, with full theming and state isolation.
- **Accessibility:** Uses accessible UI primitives (shadcn/ui, Radix UI) for keyboard and screen reader support.
- **Icons/Emojis:** Each option and step can have a unique icon (Lucide) or emoji for visual clarity.

---

## 8. Advanced Features

- **Console Functions:** Modular automation (e.g., auto-select, send brochure) can be attached to forms for advanced workflows.
- **AI Editing:** Users can edit the form by sending instructions (e.g., "Add a question about budget") and the AI will update the JSON config.
- **Prompt History:** All prompt edits are tracked and can be reviewed or reverted.

---

## 9. Extensibility

- **Adding New Step Types:** Simply create a new step component and add it to the renderer switch.
- **Custom Validation:** Each step can define its own validation logic in the config.
- **Theming:** Colors and fonts are fully customizable via the config.

## In-Depth: `form-renderer` Directory

The `form-renderer` directory is the heart of the form UI system. It contains the main orchestration logic and all the step components that render each type of form slide. The structure is modular, with each step type implemented as a dedicated React component.

### 1. `index.tsx` — Main Form Renderer

- **Role:** Orchestrates the rendering of the entire multi-step form.
- **How it works:**
  - Receives a `formConfig` (either via props or context).
  - Tracks the current step, responses, and submission state via context.
  - Renders the appropriate step component based on the current step’s `type`.
  - Handles navigation (next, previous, submit) and validation.
  - Displays a progress bar and manages the fixed footer navigation.
  - On submission, aggregates all responses and sends them to the backend.
- **Edge Cases:** If the config is missing or malformed, shows a fallback message. Handles test mode for previewing forms.

### 2. Step Components (in `form-steps/`)

Each file in `form-steps/` implements a specific step type. All are functional React components, using context for state and response management.

#### a. `tiles-step.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Single-choice selection from a grid of options.
- **Features:**
  - Auto-selects a preselected/selected option if present.
  - Uses a responsive grid layout (2x2, 3x2, etc.) based on the number of options.
  - Fetches and displays icons for each option.
  - On selection, saves the response and auto-advances to the next step.
- **Edge Cases:** Handles missing/duplicate options, and falls back to a default grid if the option count is unexpected.

#### b. `multi-select-step.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Multiple-choice selection.
- **Features:**
  - Allows selecting/deselecting any number of options.
  - Uses checkboxes and icons for each option.
  - Saves the array of selected option IDs as the response.
- **Edge Cases:** Ensures at least one selection if required. Handles empty or duplicate options.

#### c. `slider-step.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Numeric input via a slider.
- **Features:**
  - Displays a slider with min, max, and step values.
  - Shows the current value with a large, animated display.
  - Visual tick marks for min/max and intermediate values.
  - Saves the selected value as the response.
- **Edge Cases:** Defaults to `defaultValue` if no response. Disables or visually indicates if min/max/step are invalid.

#### d. `followup-step.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Conditional input (option + follow-up answer).
- **Features:**
  - User selects an option, then provides a follow-up answer (text or number).
  - Dynamically renders the follow-up input based on the selected option.
  - Saves both the selected option and follow-up value as the response.
- **Edge Cases:** Both fields must be filled to proceed. Handles missing follow-up config gracefully.

#### e. `textbox-step.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Freeform text input.
- **Features:**
  - Renders a textarea with placeholder and row count.
  - Validates required and minLength constraints.
  - Shows live error messages and character count.
- **Edge Cases:** Enforces validation before allowing navigation. Handles empty or too-short input.

#### f. `location-step.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Collects and validates user location.
- **Features:**
  - Input for full address, with postal code extraction.
  - Validates postal code using the Nominatim API.
  - Shows success/error messages and a visual confirmation.
  - Saves the full address, postal code, and availability status as the response.
- **Edge Cases:** Handles various postal code formats (US, Canada, UK, India). Shows clear errors for invalid or missing input.

#### g. `document-upload-step.tsx`
- **Purpose:** File upload (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- **Features:**
  - Drag-and-drop area and file picker.
  - Shows upload status and file name.
  - Uploads file to the backend and saves the document URL and extracted text as the response.
- **Edge Cases:** Accepts only allowed file types/sizes. Shows errors for failed uploads. Handles both string and object responses.

#### h. `document-info-step.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Displays extracted information from the uploaded document.
- **Features:**
  - Renders a summary of all form responses and extracted document content.
  - Can generate a quotation (e.g., for translation services) using an AI API.
  - Allows toggling between document info and the generated quotation.
- **Edge Cases:** Handles missing or empty document content. Shows errors if quotation generation fails.

#### i. `contact-step.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Collects user contact information.
- **Features:**
  - Input fields for first name, last name, email, and phone.
  - Validates required fields and email format.
  - Shows live error messages.
  - Displays additional contact/help info from the config.
- **Edge Cases:** Enforces required fields and valid email. Handles missing/invalid input gracefully.

#### j. `submission-step.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Final thank-you/confirmation screen.
- **Features:**
  - Displays a summary of the submission process.
  - Allows the user to start over (reset the form).
- **Edge Cases:** Handles missing or malformed submission config.

### 3. Root Files

#### a. `tiles-step.tsx` and `multi-select-step.tsx` (root)
- **Note:** These are stubs or legacy files. The main logic is in the `form-steps/` directory. They may exist for backward compatibility or as simple wrappers.

#### b. `embed-form-renderer.tsx`
- **Role:** Variant of the main renderer for embedded forms (e.g., in iframes).
- **Differences:** Handles prop-based config, context sync, and may have additional logic for embedding scenarios.

#### c. `embed-form-steps/`
- **Role:** Mirrors the `form-steps/` directory but for embedded forms. Logic is nearly identical, but may have tweaks for embedding (e.g., styling, event handling).

**Design Philosophy:**  
- Each step is self-contained, responsible for its own UI, validation, and response logic.
- The main renderer is agnostic to step details, simply delegating to the correct component.
- All state and navigation is managed via React context, ensuring consistency and easy extensibility.
